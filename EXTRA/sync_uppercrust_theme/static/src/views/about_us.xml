                            At Synconics, we firmly believe that our vision is the driving force behind our growth. Our desire was, and still is, to build an institution that would outlast our lives, and a strong inclination towards being driven by values. While defining our vision, we asked ourselves some fundamental questions: • What is core to the organization? • What is the purpose for which we exist? • How do we envision our future? • What goals do we set ourselves? • What are our dreams? The answers to these questions would give us an idea as to how we would respond to the rapidly changing environment of business. The process of answering these questions was neither quick, not painless, since we often had to come face to face with our deepest concerns. Ultimately however, we believe that we have been able to filter through the noise and settle on what truly defines Synconics as an organization. • We seek to transform ourselves by giving everyone in our team an environment where we can achieve our true potential. • We seek to transform society by using our skills and resource to set people free from poverty, fear and whatever may hold them back from being everything that they ought to become.
